## Experiments for Project

### Experiment 1
#### Setting up API calls to Google Calendar
Using OAuth to connect to Google Calendar.



### Experiment 2
#### Setting up broadcasting (Elixir app)
For Experiment 2, we are testing out the two types of users, Managers and Employees.
We want to set up websockets so users can chat with each other and managers can broadcast messages to their team.


### Experiment 3
#### Testing out ReactJS framework 
In exp3/calendar-app, run the command 'npm start'
The app can be viewed in http://localhost:8080/
For the third experiment, we are trying out ReactJS, neither of us have a lot experience in it.
The app is from an employee perspective and they can view their tasks and proposed shifts for the upcoming week or view all shifts by month.
